# a-recommender-system
The ML project uses an implementation of the renowned but simple Apriori algorithms to extract association rules from different shopping basket and then output items that were likely to be purchased together. This could be useful for a grocery store manager to know exactly what their customers have been purchasing together and improved on his craft at organising and promoting items in the store.
